Python excercize:

This Python code loads data from a CSV file named "iris.csv" stored in a Google Drive folder and creates a Pandas dataframe named 'df'. The dataframe is then modified to have appropriate column names. The code then generates a boxplot using Seaborn to display the average sepal length of each species of iris.

The next part of the code authenticates the user for accessing the Google Sheets API and imports data from a Google Sheet named "PGSS2023". The data is then converted into a Pandas dataframe named 'df2'. Finally, the last line of code selects a subset of rows and columns from the 'df2' dataframe and displays them.
